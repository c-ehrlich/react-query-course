# react-query-course
## What is this?
These are my versions of some of the apps from the old React Query tutorial videos, as well as some notes on some of the chapters.

## How is it different from just apps in the videos?
I used a newer version of React Query that moved several older abstractions into the QueryController among other changes and thus had to rebuild a lot of the code by reading the docs alongside following the tutorial. Also unlike the tutorial I built everything with TypeScript, which requires significant extra work for some aspects of React Query. I did my best to use good TypeScript practices.

The Mutations app requires a backend, so instead of taking the time to build that myself I decided to just take notes, and then go and a full project with a backend myself later that uses the same mutation concepts. You can see this project [here](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/rq-nextjs-posts).

## What did I learn
Thanks to the additional work of using a newer version of React Query as well as TypeScript and the reading of docs this required me to do to get things to work, I now feel ready to use React Query in a large, real project.
